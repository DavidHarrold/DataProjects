Created using Microsoft Excel and Power BI, I used a dataset from kaggle to compare and analyse data pertaining to employment of different roles within the industry.
Explore a comprehensive view into the data and check out my dashboard where I approach from three angles: Salary, Geographic and Company Analysis, comparing the roles with the best potential earnings, the best locations for data roles across the globe and what sized company may be best to work for.
In addition to my four-page dashboard, you are also invited to read my discussion and thoughts on what the data shows in the Written Analysis .docx file.
